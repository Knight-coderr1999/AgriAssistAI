# AgriAssist AI â€” Agentic Advisory for Indian Farmers

Short: AgriAssist AI is a multilingual, hybrid online/offline agentic advisory system for smallholder farmers (voice-first, RAG-grounded, HITL + XAI).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


// For to run Frontend

First, make sure you have Node.js and Git installed on your computer.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
This command downloads a copy of your project from GitHub to your computer.
Open your terminal.
Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project (like your Deskop).
Run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Knight-coderr1999/AgriAssistAI.git

Step 2: Go into the Project Folder
After the download is complete, you need to move into the project's directory.

cd AgriAssistAI

Step 3: Install Dependencies
This command reads the package.json file and installs all the necessary packages (like React, Tailwind CSS, etc.) that your project needs to run.

npm install

Step 4: Run the Application
This is the final step. It starts the local development server.

npm run dev

Your terminal will show you a local URL, which is usually http://localhost:5173. Open this link in your web browser, and you will see your running application.
